Welcome to my **Lab Challenges** dashboard. 

In cybersecurity and cloud engineering, theoretical knowledge must be backed by hands-on execution. This section serves as a living log of my ongoing simulations, digital forensics challenges, and network architecture builds.

---

### 🌐 1. Network Architecture & Security (Cisco Packet Tracer)
Designing secure, resilient network topologies from the ground up.
* **Switch Security Configuration:** Hardening networks by implementing VLAN segregation, Port Security, DHCP Snooping, and BPDU Guard.
* **Routing Protocols:** Configuring dynamic routing and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to block unauthorized IP addresses and secure vulnerable ports.

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. Digital Forensics & Traffic Analysis (Blue Team)
Hunting for indicators of compromise (IoCs) within network traffic.
* **PCAP Analysis:** Utilizing **Wireshark** and **tcpdump** to dissect raw `.pcap` files and trace simulated attacker lateral movement.
* **Payload Extraction:** Filtering TCP streams, decrypting RDP traffic using session keys, and extracting malicious artifacts directly from packet captures.
* **TryHackMe / HackTheBox:** Actively completing Blue Team and SOC Analyst defensive rooms.

### ☁️ 3. Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
Applying the principle of least privilege in cloud environments.
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Architecting secure user groups, roles, and strict JSON-based permission policies for EC2 instances.
* **VPC Configuration:** Building secure Virtual Private Clouds to isolate development and production workloads.

### 🔧 4. Hardware & IoT Integration
Bridging the gap between physical sensors and logical control.
* **Microcontroller Systems:** Designing C++ firmware for multi-sensor safety systems (Fire, Gas, and Sound detection) and troubleshooting real-world circuit voltage drops.
