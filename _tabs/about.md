Hi, I’m Breyn.
I am a Control and Instrumentation Engineer with a passion for bringing physical systems into the digital world.

I specialize in bridging the gap between factory-floor hardware and cloud infrastructure. With a background in industrial automation and sensor integration, combined with my certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner, I build and troubleshoot systems that are smart, scalable, and reliable.

Whether I am diagnosing electrical faults on a production line or configuring cloud architecture to monitor real-time data, my goal is to make complex systems run seamlessly. When I am not working with circuits or AWS, I am usually exploring the latest trends in AI and cybersecurity.
